import sys
count=0
with open(sys.argv[1],'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            word=line.split()
            count+=len(word)
print("Word Count in File=",count)
from shutil import copyfile
from sys import exit

source = input("Enter source file with full path: ")
target = input("Enter target file with full path: ")

# adding exception handling
try:
    copyfile(source, target)
except IOError as e:
    print("Unable to copy file. %s" % e)
    exit(1)
except:
    print("Unexpected error:", sys.exc_info())
    exit(1)

print("\nFile copy done!\n")

while True:
    print("Do you like to print the file ? (y/n): ")
    check = input()
    if check == 'n':
        break
    elif check == 'y':
        file = open(target, "r")
        print("\nHere follows the file content:\n")
        print(file.read())
        file.close()
        print()
        break
    else:
        continue
